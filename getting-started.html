    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
  Learning is based on playing words and phrases using the <strong>Text-to-Speech (TTS)</strong> system. 
  This requires text content that can be spoken aloud.
</p>

<p>
  The core unit of learning is a <strong>Topic</strong>: a pair of 
  <em>text in the Primary language</em> and its <em>translation in the Secondary language</em>. </p>
<img class="screenshot" style="max-width:100%; margin:1rem 0;" src="img/help_gs_topic.png" alt="Topic screenshot">  
<p>  Topics are grouped into <strong>Chapters</strong>, where you define which language is primary and which is secondary.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>Secondary</strong> part is optional — you can focus on pronunciation only, without translations.
</p>

<p>
  Topics can also be grouped (for example, related or root words), but only a single nesting level is supported.
</p>

<p>
  For better learning, the spoken text can differ from the text displayed on the screen. 
  This is useful when the written text contains clarifications or notes.
</p>

<h3>Playlists</h3>
<p>
  To start learning, you create a <strong>Playlist</strong> — add several chapters and choose their playback order. 
  Once created, the playlist appears on the main screen and can be launched.
</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>
  Settings allow you to control the length of pauses between topics, 
  as well as internal pauses between word and translation.
</p>
<p>
  You can also disable speech output entirely if you prefer to learn only by reading 
  and focusing on spelling and translation.
</p>

<h3>Demo data</h3>
<p>
  The app comes with a <strong>demo database</strong>. You can modify it freely, and if needed, 
  reset it to its original state by clearing the app data.
</p>

<h3>Import &amp; Export</h3>
<p>
  The app supports import and export of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>individual <strong>Chapters</strong>,</li>
  <li>entire <strong>Playlists</strong>,</li>
  <li>or the <strong>full database</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This makes it easy to share lessons with friends, create backups, or use the data for your own purposes.
